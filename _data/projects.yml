It quickly gained popularity among people learning to build XMPP chat systems targeting android devices. I find myself giving paid support to many happy learners since then.

  description: Following the success of <a href="https://github.com/blikoon/Rooster">Rooster</a>, I have been getting many email requesting for help and support about such and such feature. That's why I distilled down all that valuable feedback into a PAID video course that any SERISOUS interested learner could pick up and be able to build a smack based instant messenger on android in record time. The course is currently released and AVAILABLE on our <a href="https://blikoon.teachable.com/">Online School</a>.

- project: Android QR Code Scanner Library
  role: Lead Developer
  duration: 2017 &mdash; Present
  url: "https://github.com/blikoon/QRCodeScanner"
  description: This library was developed because we needed such a feature in <a href="http://www.blikoontech.com/salama">Salama</a>. Now building a library yourself is crasy right ? We built it because we needed to build some business around that technology in some near future. What better way to dive deep in the tech than building a library for that tech! Salama uses this library already and we are getting some early adpters using it now.
